    <string name="welcome">Welcome to the Android version of Simon Tatham\'s Puzzles. N.B. the trackball is easier to use than the touchscreen for most of these. For right-click, press the camera button halfway or do a long press on the touchscreen. Online help is available under Menu/Help. This project is released under the MIT license.</string>
